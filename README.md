Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic approach of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems.
Software engineerig is the backbone of the tech industry because every aspect of technology revolves around software from the apps on our phones to the big e-commerce systems ensuring that everything works at scale, are secure and can adapt to changing demand.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Complexity- The transition from writing in a way that could not be easily understood to structured programming and object oriented programming enabled programmers to handle more complex programs.
Process - The agile movement broke the rigid waterfall method creating flexible workflows and continuous iterative delivery helping teams adapt to changing requirements and ensure ongoing quality.
Machine - Devops practices automized development testing and deployment ensuring software can be deployed quickly and efficiently, increasing speed reliability and maintainability at scale.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - This is where the project scope is defined, undestanding what the software is for, the end users and resources needed to build it.
Requirement analysis - This is where feasibility of th eproject is analyzed from multiple perspectives e.g operational technical and financial and also gathering user requirements and documenting them clearly.
Design - This is where the software architecture, user interface are created.
Implementation - Actual coding of the software takes place in this phase.
Teating- Ensures the code works as expected and meets all requirements. It also ensurea that bugss are found and fixed ensuring performance and security.
Deployment - Once the the code has been tested it is released to a production environment for real user to access.
Maintenance - After deployment it is monitored, updated and patched based on real time feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental in terms of approach. In terms of flexibility, waterfall is rigid and changes are difficult to incorporate while agile is very flexibleand changes can be incorporated at any stage. Requirements are clearly defined at the beginning and are not easily changed in the waterfall method while changes evolve overtime based on feedback. In waterfall documentation is extensive and upfront while in agile it is minimal and focus is more on functionality. In waterfall testing occurs at the end after development while in agile its continuous happening in every sprint. In waterfall their is high risk because of lack of flexibility because of late testing while in aglie there is lower risk because feedback and testing are incorporated early.

waterfall can be used in compliance reporting in healthcare, banking and defense because of strick regulatory requirements where everystep is supposed to be clearly documented and followed in a predetermined way. while agile can be used in e-commerce platforms where it requires contunuous updates and features based on real time customer feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and implements software solution.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software products meet quality standards and functional requirements.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of softaware projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's help developers to streamline the development workflow by making it easy to write,debug and test code. eg VS Code 
Version Control Systems are tools that help developers track, store and manage changes made on code base. eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Handling tight dealines. 
This can be caused by too much pressure at work leading to burnouts and delivering substandard quality work.They can adopt agile frameworks to help the have flexibility and better time management.
Technology advancement.
With technology advancement new languages, libraries and tools emerge and it can be overwhelming to keep up, to solve this developers have to adopt to continuous learning, collaborating with peers and focusing on fundamentals.
Security and privacy concerns
Security can be a big challenge especially when protecting user data and preventing unauthorised access. Security can be maximized by following security best practices, encrypting user data, use security toolsto detect security issues and having security audits often.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests the individual components of the system like functions and methods. It is important for eary bug detection, improve code reliability and reduce future defects.
Integration testing ensures thst different components of the system interact correctly. It ensures seamless component interaction, reduces system failures and catches interface mismatches.
System testing validates the entire system as a whole. It ensures that the whole application works as expected and that the components, dependancies and imtegration fuction properly together ensureing performance, security and scalability in production.
Acceptance testing validates if the software meets business requirements. Ensures software aligns with the business goals and meet end user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promptengineering is crafting statements to get the best possible answers from an AI model. This helps to maximize model performance and enhance user experience by tailoring our statement to precision.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
